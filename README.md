OpenSSL & NTL library  

This code can be combined with other batch encryption techniques. For details on other batch encryption techniques, refer to “Two-Sided Malicious Security for Private Intersection-Sum with Cardinality.” When employing batch encryption where multiple ciphertexts share the first part, the code requires additional initialization of multiple Camenisch-Shoup public-private key pairs for use in subsequent stages.
